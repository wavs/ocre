Building OCRe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please refer to the file INSTALL for help on building OCRopus from
source.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executing OCRe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hence you have run Make, you should have a bin directory.
Where you will found three binaries:
      * OCRed which processes rotation and tresholding
      * gui which is at that time a beta-gui
      * extract which processes line detection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * the OCRed program is quite complexe:
          - you have to set the input image whith the -i option
          - you may specify an output, but it's not a must have,
             whithout this option the executable save an image
             whith different name in different path:
             example : rotation.bmp treshold.bmp
              (*sorry for the error*) in the current directory.
              The executable could write a file in the upper
              directory. We don't really know how it works.
          - you may set the angle for rotation if you want one,
            the angle is in degree. You have to use -a option for
            this.
          - you may set the treshold with -s option
            (s like seuil in french). example: -s 300 is quite well.
          - whith option -d it displays an ouput in a windows
                 * press F1 to quit
                 * press F2 to rotate or something
                   whitout an angle it processes whith a 0 degree
                   it enlarges your image ;)
                 * press F3 to treshold
                 * press F4 to filter with median filter
                 !WARNING don't press F4 then F3, tresholding do
                 its job only with colour.
          - whithout this option
             It makes what you want. More or Less.

        * the gui is able to load and print an image

        * extract takes a black&white bitmap image in input
          with the option -i and it saves the preview with -o
          The output image shows the text lines between two lines
