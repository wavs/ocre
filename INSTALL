OCRe - open source document analysis and OCR system 
(www.huge.ocre.free.fr)
This is an EPITA's student project.

Version 0.0.1 (2008-01-??)

This file contains information for building OCRe on a Linux System, 
but also on a FreeBSD Sytem.
For differences on other platforms, please have a look at:
http://huge.ocre.free.fr

The following building instructions are divided into
- how to build OCRe once you have installed all needed software

Please note that you need to run all listed "make install" commands
with root privileges, e.g by running "sudo make install" instead,
or by running "su" and typing your root password.

Building OCRe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
After installing the needed software (see below) go to the Ocropus 
release directory and run:
    * ./configure (complains about unmet requirements)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements - basic OCRe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following software really needs to be installed for running OCRe:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Software - basic OCRe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * libaspell-dev (or equivalent) for spell checking
    * aspell-en     (or equivalent)
    * aspell-fr     (indeed)
      Without aspell, OCRes needs a different UTF-8 encoded word list.
      By default, it will look into /usr/share/dict/words; 
you can supply
      a different location through the "wordlist" environment variable.
      The file `data/words/en-us' does the job.

Please use the external repository of OCRopus for the following 
software:
    * svn checkout http://ocropus.googlecode.com/svn/external 
ocropus-external
    * openfst (library for weighted finite-state transducers)
      * cd ocropus-external/fst-ocropus/fst;
      * ./configure; make; make install

We use OCRopus as base for our files and others things.

other software:
libsdl caml and leptonica
